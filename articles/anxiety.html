    <p>Table 3.15DSM-IV to DSM-5 Generalized Anxiety Disorder Comparison
        DSM-IV	--DSM-5
        Disorder Class: Anxiety Disorders	--SAME
        A. Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance).	--SAME
        B. The person finds it difficult to control the worry.	--SAME
        C. The anxiety and worry are associated with three or more of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms present for more days than not for the past 6 months).
