      <h1>Developmental Disorders</h1>
      <article>
      <p>To understand developmental disorders is for a person to take themselves out of their mind and watch how it works.  The mechanisms underlying how the brain functions are difficult to observe while inhabiting a mind, in the same way that a driver knows they are in a car but may not be aware of how their driving is percieved by others, if there is mud on the wheels, or if the car is drifting into oncoming traffic.</p>
      <p>Developmental Disorders can be observed by the self through introspection.  IE this is the steering wheel.  These are the pedals.  Or through examination of the Other and comparitive differences between them.  Psychologists have historically disregarded the experience of drivers, opting instead to compare behavior and come to conclusions.  While this may work in some instances, a lack of verification with the driver and a lack of awareness of the "real" mechanisms underlying behavior has discredited the field by those most in need of its help.</p>
      <p>In short, underlying conditions dictate behavior, not the other way around.  A driver, knowing their car has poor brakes, may drive slowly and give distance to their peers.  An outside observer may wrongly assume this is a problem of acceleration or anxiety on the part of the driver.  Without the driver's perspective, this would be impossible to know.</p>
